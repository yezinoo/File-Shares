Hi team,

I would like to share the results of the PurpleKnight assessment conducted on my vulnerable Active Directory environment. Since the message is long, I’m sending it via email instead of Teams.

Most vulnerabilities were identified as IOEs in PurpleKnight. In addition, recent activities in AD, such as privilege changes and AD settings modifications, were also detected.

The overall grade is determined by varying weights for five different categories: **AD Delegation, Account Security, AD Infrastructure Security, Group Policy Security,** and **Kerberos Security**. 

The Domain Controller is vulnerable to the following attacks:

- Abusing ACLs/ACEs
- Kerberoasting
- AS-REP Roasting
- Abuse of DnsAdmins
- Passwords in Object Descriptions
- User Objects with Default Passwords (e.g., Changeme123!)
- Password Spraying
- DCSync
- Silver Ticket
- Golden Ticket
- Pass-the-Hash
- Pass-the-Ticket
- SMB Signing Disabled

The assessment was performed from a domain-joined computer (not directly on the Domain Controller), assuming we would not have direct access to the DC. I tested PurpleKnight in three scenarios:

1. Normal user (no privileges)
2. Normal user with local admin rights
3. High-privilege user with Domain Admin rights

No additional configurations were applied, such as bypassing PowerShell execution policies, since PurpleKnight is distributed as an executable.

After reviewing the results, my first impression is that PurpleKnight is very convenient — similar to using Nessus, but focused on Active Directory. Interestingly, the normal user scenario detected more IOEs than the higher-privilege scenarios. I am investigating why this occurred.

For your reference, I have attached the test results. Please review them at your convenience.

Regarding detection, I checked the Domain Controller audit logs and found out PurpleKnight activities, such as Kerberoasting. However, because Directory Service Access auditing is not enabled, I could not see scans of AD objects (e.g., Domain Admins, ACLs, GPOs). I believe that EDR or MDI could detect such PurpleKnight activity.

For Entra ID testing, additional configuration would be required (e.g., permissions, Azure registration). If possible, I think we should test PurpleKnight on Entra ID as well.

Best regards,
