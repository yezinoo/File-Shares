Comprehensive Identity Security Assessment Tool
PurpleKnight, developed by Semperis, is a free, agentless security assessment tool designed to uncover weaknesses across Active Directory (AD), Entra ID (Azure AD), and Okta environments.

Cross-Platform Visibility
It helps organizations identify misconfigurations, risky permissions, and exposure paths in hybrid identity infrastructures—covering both on-premises and cloud-based identity systems.

Compliance-Friendly and CBDM-Safe
PurpleKnight runs locally, ensuring no data leaves the organization, making it ideal for industries like finance, where Cross-Border Data Movement (CBDM) restrictions apply.

Actionable Reporting
After scanning, it provides a security score and detailed remediation guidance, categorized by key domains such as privileged accounts, Kerberos configurations, and identity federation.

Quick and Non-Intrusive Deployment
No agents, no domain controller modifications — scans can be run safely in production environments without disrupting daily operations.

Ideal for Auditing and Continuous Improvement
PurpleKnight supports internal audits, cyber hygiene programs, and regulatory compliance checks by offering clear, evidence-based findings and trend tracking over time.
