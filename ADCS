I would like to share the results of the PurpleKnight assessment conducted on my vulnerable Active Directory environment. Since the message is quite long, I’m sending it via email instead of Teams.

Most vulnerabilities were identified as IoCs in PurpleKnight. In addition, recent activities in AD, such as privilege changes and AD configuration modifications, were also detected.

The overall grade is determined by varying weights across five categories: AD Delegation, Account Security, AD Infrastructure Security, Group Policy Security, and Kerberos Security.

The Domain Controller was found to be vulnerable to the following attacks:

Abusing ACLs/ACEs

Kerberoasting

AS-REP Roasting

Abuse of DnsAdmins

Passwords in Object Descriptions

User Objects with Default Passwords (e.g., Changeme123!)

Password Spraying

DCSync

Silver Ticket

Golden Ticket

Pass-the-Hash

Pass-the-Ticket

SMB Signing Disabled

The assessment was performed from a domain-joined workstation (not directly on the Domain Controller), assuming we would not have direct access to the DC. I tested PurpleKnight in three different scenarios:

Normal user (no privileges)

Normal user with local admin rights

High-privilege user with Domain Admin rights

No additional configurations were applied, such as bypassing PowerShell execution policies, since PurpleKnight is distributed as an executable.

After reviewing the results, my first impression is that PurpleKnight is very convenient — similar to using Nessus, but focused on Active Directory.
Interestingly, the normal user scenario revealed more indicators of exposure than the higher-privilege scans, which suggests that several misconfigurations are visible even to low-privileged accounts. I am currently investigating this further to understand the underlying cause.

For your reference, I have attached the test results. Please review them at your convenience.

Regarding detection, I checked the Domain Controller audit logs and observed PurpleKnight activities, such as Kerberoasting. However, because Directory Service Access auditing is not enabled, I could not see detailed scans of AD objects (e.g., Domain Admins, ACLs, GPOs). I believe EDR or Microsoft Defender for Identity could help detect such PurpleKnight activities.

For Entra ID testing, additional configurations would be required (e.g., permissions and Azure app registration). If possible, I recommend performing a similar assessment on Entra ID as well.

Best regards,
